# About

Hello! This repository holds portraits I have created using the `rayshader` R package by **[Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall)**. Towards the end of December 2022, I became heavily inspired by the incredible work of **[@researchremora](https://twitter.com/researchremora)** and their awesome `rayshader` portraits.

I am learning how to use the `rayshader` R package and will update this repository with my creations. A special thank you to **[Spencer Schien](https://github.com/Pecners)** for his fantastic **[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgFXVhmKNbU&t)** which has served as a great resource for my learning and getting started with the coding aspect of making these portraits. Code snippets for my first two portraits are based on the linked tutorial above.
