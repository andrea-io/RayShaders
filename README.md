# About

Hello! This repository holds portraits I have created using the `rayshader` R package by [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall). Towards the end of December 2022, I became heavily inspired by the incredible work of [@researchremora](https://twitter.com/researchremora) and their awesome Rayshader portraits.

I am learning how to use the `rayshader` R package and will update this repository with my creations. A special thank you to [Spencer Schien](https://github.com/Pecners) for his fantastic [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgFXVhmKNbU&t) which has served as a great resource for my learning and getting started with the coding aspect of making these portraits. Code snippets for my first two portraits are based on the linked tutorial above.

I hope you enjoy viewing my portraits! I am open to feedback and suggestions.
